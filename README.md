### Hi, I'm Joe

I'm currently a Software Designer at Ford. 

I've previously worked as a Technology Consultant at Arup.

I like building tools for fellow makers and designing excellent user experiences.

I'm also an audio + music nerd.

Most of my work is in private repos or enterprise GitHub instances, but feel free to [get in touch](https://joehornby.co.uk) to see some projects.
